# task-manager-app
Hello folks, this project will help you to create your tasks that you want to do throughout the day like for example, read a newpaper, go to shopping, etc. And, then on each successful entry of a task of yours for the day through a form "add task", you will be redirected to the whole list of your tasks that you might had added till then. Now, the list of your tasks would be displayed in a tabular format containing column fields like Title (title of the task), Description (description of the task), Date (according to the date when the task was added) and Time (according to the time when the task was added), and the other two columns will be for you to take actions like update a specific task or delete a specific task and according to your actions the project will either delete your task from the list or redirect you again to the "add task" form with all the details of that particular task that you had decided to update, in order to, update that task and so on, by filling that form with the updated data, you will again be redirected to the list of your tasks with all the updated data this time.

But before performing all the CRUD operations related to your task for the day, you will have to signup yourself as a user for the app through a signup form and then also login yourself for getting authenticated as a user of the app and then you will be redirected to the main/home page of the app. On the main/home page of the app, you will get to see the profile picture and username of yours, alongwith the "welcome message", that you had uploaded while submitting or signing up with the signup form.

In authentication part, if you haven't registered yourself as a user for the app, and tried to login then you won't fall under the category of "authentic users" and you will be again redirected to the login form with an error message this time, which will say "user not found" and if you have already registered yourself as a user of the app with the signup form, and while logging in, if you might have entered the wrong password then also you won't be redirected to the app's main/home page rather than that you will be again redirected to the login form with an error message saying "password doesn't match". And apart from all these, if you had already once registered yourself as a user using the signup form and again try to register yourself with the same credentials as before then you won't be able to register rather you would be again redirected to the signup form with an error message saying "user already exists". And all the same stuff also applies while adding your task using the add task form, like if try to add the similar task again that you might had added before then you won't be allowed rather you would be redirected again to the add task form with an error message saying "task already exists". 

If in case, you decide to download the code from my git hub repository, then after downloading and opening the project's folder in the visual studio code or any other code editor of your choice, you will once have to open the terminal or command prompt and run the command "npm install", in order to install all the dependencies for the project and then and only then you will be able to run the project on your computer.

Thanks for reading, i hope it will help you while exploring this project.
